# Extension Icons

This directory contains the extension icons in three required sizes:

- **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels (shown in browser toolbar)
- **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels (shown in extensions management page)
- **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels (shown in Chrome Web Store, if published)

All icons feature a Google Docs-style blue document with an equals sign and pi symbol, representing mathematical equations. The icons have transparent backgrounds for better integration with different Chrome themes.
